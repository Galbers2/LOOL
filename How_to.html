            <h3><i class="fas fa-apple-alt"></i> 1. Recover Uneaten Food</h3>
    <br>
        <p>Food donation is indemnified by the Emerson Good Samaritan Food Recovery Act protection entities from liability, however the safe handling of
             perishable food is essential.  This option requires installation of a mini refrigerator inside cafeterias where students can place unwanted milks, 
             yogurt and other perishable food items.  Schools can solicit fundsto pay for the refrigerator and a 
             student led green team should monitor and clean refrigerators and arrange for food runners to deliver to a local food bank weekly. </p>

    <div class="card" id="step2">
        <h3><i class="fas fa-recycle"></i> 2. Decontaminate Recycling</h3>
    <p> Many schools do not recycle and deposit recyclable materials in the trash.  It is cheaper to landfill than to recycle and most recycling containers are badly 
        contaminated.  School green team leaders and students have the opportunity to teach schools which items can be recycled and ensure contamination is eliminated. 
         Student green teams can volunteer to collect recycle containers from cafeterias as well as classrooms, extract contaminated materials and ensure the material 
         is correctly place in the recycle dumpsters.

    <div class="card" id="step3">
        <h3><i class="fas fa-wine-bottle"></i> 3. Extract Liquids</h3>
    <p> If liquids are left in containers those containers are no longer recyclable.  Providing a 5 gallon bucket with a bucket screen can eliminate as much as 20% of 
        the weight of cafeteria trash. 
        Disposal of the liquids must meet grease trap regulations but ‚ÄúDilution is the Solution to Pollution‚Äù. A water hose can eliminate issues with disposal in Mop 
        sinks.</p>

        <h3><i class="fas fa-box-open"></i> 4. Plastic Film Collection</h3>
    <p> NexTrex collects plastic films as a building material for Trex plastic decking.  Plastic film generated in schools is minimal but if  students can collect 
        plastic film from home and bring to school on designated collection days and participate in the NexTrex challenge.  Flexible plastic materials can be weighed 
        by students and taken to the local supermarket where the material is taken to the distribution center to be baled and collected by Trex in every community in 
        the US</p>

    <div class="card" id="step5">
        <h3><i class="fas fa-seedling"></i> 5. Compost Organic Material</h3>
    <p>Commercial compost capacity is still limited but increasing exponentially in communities throughout the country,   While compost operations on school grounds 
        is ideal it limits organic diversion to fruits and vegetables and done with a high level of expertise.  Commercial compost operators can compost anything that 
        can be eaten including meat and dairy and organics comprise 50% of all cafeteria generated waste.    Compost haulers collect material weekly in 65 gallon bins 
        that are pest proof and exchanged with each pick up.  Yes for hauling can cost as much as $2000 annually but the reduction of 50% of the organics,  liquids 
        extraction, proper recycling and food recovery can reduce the number of dumpster pick ups and prove to be cost neutral.</p>
